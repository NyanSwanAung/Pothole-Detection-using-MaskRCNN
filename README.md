This repository includes 
* Results folder which contains the detected image and video of Mask-RCNN 
* Training Pipeline for Mask-RCNN using Tensorflow Object Detection API **(TF-OD-API)** on Pothole Dataset
* Pre-trained weights and inference graph of Pothole Dataset
* Inference code on test dataset 

## Instructions
